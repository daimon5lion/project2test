Movie List is an application that can perform a search of a movie by name and, depending on whether the movie has been stored onto the database, display the movie to the user.  The user can either keep the movie on their to-watch list or place the movie on the already-watched list.  Selecting a movie will display various information about it along with a watchable trailer from Youtube.
